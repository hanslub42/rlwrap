Chet Ramey <chet at po.cwru.edu>: author of the amazing readline 
library, around which rlwrap is but a thin wrapper.

Hans Lub hanslub42@gmail.com: most of the rlwrap code, except for:

- ptytty.c, wich was taken practically unchanged from rxvt
  (currently maintained by Geoff C. Wing  <gcw@rxvt.org>),
  together with the corresponding part of configure.ac

- completion.c which contains the redblack tree implementation written
  by Damian Ivereigh (with contributions by  Ben Woodard, Eric S. Raymond
  and Matthias Andree)

Jon Olsson (jon at vexed.se) contributed patches to weed out unsafe
strcat and strcpy calls

Hisanobu Okuda ported the RlwrapFilter.pm perl module (and a number
of example filters) to python, and contributed a new way of handling 
multi-part filter messages.

Robert Kroeger contributed code to keep track of the rlwrapped command's
working directory under OS X

Yuri d'Elia contributed the code for the rlwrap-direct-keypress
bindable readline command
