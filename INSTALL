PREREQUISITES

To build rlwrap, you'll need an ANSI C compiler (gcc will certainly
do) and GNU readline 4.2 or later. rlwrap should compile on most
unices and unix-like environments like linux, the BSDs, OS/X, solaris,
HP/UX, QNX, AIX and cygwin (special thanks to PolarHome for their
"dinosaur zoo" of ageing Unix systems!)

INSTALLATION

./configure
make
make install

If the configure script is not found, you can recreate it, and all of the other 
files it needs, by:

aclocal
autoconf
autoheader
automake --add-missing

or, even shorter:

autoreconf --install


CONFIGURATION OPTIONS

configure can be called with a number of options (e.g. if you want to
install rlwrap in a non-standard place). Do

./configure --help

to see them all. Most of them are not specific to rlwrap, except the
following three:

--enable-spy-on-readline : If we want to keep the display tidy when
re-sizing the terminal window or printing multi-line prompts, we have
to know whether or not readline is in horizontal-scroll-mode
(i.e. wheter long lines are scrolled or wrapped). At present, this
involves a look at a private readline variable - if you feel guilty
about that, disable this option.

--enable-homegrown-redisplay: some people report ddouble echoing of
user input. Enabling this option will cure the problem - though the
display will then flicker over slow connections (cf. BUGS)

--enable-debug: Adds a --debug option to rlwrap's repertoire. This
will make rlwrap write debug information to a file /tmp/rlwrap.debug
(cf. the output of rlwrap --help for more info)


UNINSTALLATION

To uninstall, do 'make uninstall'

INSTALLING AS NON-ROOT

If you want to install rlwrap as non-root, you should call configure with
the --prefix option, like:

./configure --prefix=$HOME

after which 'make install' will install rlwrap in $HOME/bin

You may have to install GNU readline (e.g using ./configure
--prefix=$HOME in the readline source directory)

rlwrap's configure script will not find this installation automatically, but

./configure --prefix=$HOME CFLAGS=-I$HOME/include CPPFLAGS=-I$HOME/include LDFLAGS=-L$HOME/lib

should work. You can add '-static' to LDFLAGS if you want to build a statically linked rlwrap.
