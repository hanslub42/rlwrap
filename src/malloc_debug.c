/*  malloc_debug.c: attempt at malloc/free replacement for debugging
    configure with --enable-debug to use it. Nowadays, valgrind
    will often be more useful.

    When configured with --enable-debug, and run with the DEBUG_MALLOC
    bit set this will log (in the debug log /tmp/rlwrap.debug) all
    malloc() and free() calls made by rlwrap (but not those made on
    behalf of rlwrap in library routines)

    At program exit this will log a list of all unfreed() memory
    blocks on the heap

    if DEBUG_WITH_TIMESTAMPS is set in debug  , the timestamp of those
    blocks (i.e. of their allocation) will be listed as well.
